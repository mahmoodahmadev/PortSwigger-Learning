# PortSwigger Academy Learnings

This repository documents my journey through the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security), where I solve each lab and record detailed notes for every challenge and concept encountered.

## About

- **Purpose:**  
  Track my progress, share insights, and serve as a public proof of completion for PortSwigger Academy labs.
- **Content:**  
  For each lab and topic, you'll find:
  - Step-by-step walkthroughs
  - Payloads and techniques used
  - Issues encountered and solutions
  - Key takeaways and conceptual notes

## Structure

  - Numbered subfolders for individual labs
  - A `Notes.md` file for each lab with my write-up and findings
  - A `00 - Notes` folder for general concepts and summaries
